The cool thing about it is that the pollution can be outside of the city and not in the city. (Like in San Francisco, the electric buses generate the same pollution as a gas buses it is just not in the city.You can also add that electric engines are much quieter then gas engines.So- all in all- I the hybrid benefits are more visible in city driving"}]}
